            ecosystem to reward content creators for their hard work by voting on their
            videos and by content creators, which are also token owners, to publish their
            videos. VIEW token is an ERC-20 compliant token on the Ethereum

          <p>A reward period is a 24 hour window which binds the videos published within

            You can always check how rewards are distributed by accessing the following
