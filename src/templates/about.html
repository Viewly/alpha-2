        <h3>What is Viewly Alpha?</h3>
        Viewly Alpha is an experimental <i>prototype</i>, built with cool tech like Ethereum and
        IPFS.
        Alpha is not production ready, nor is it representative of the final Viewly
        product.

        <h3>Source Code</h3>
        You can find the source of the underlying Ethereum contracts <a href="https://github.com/Viewly/platform-contracts">here</a>.
        The IPFS infrastructure and other tools will be open-sourced and published on our
        <a href="https://github.com/Viewly">GitHub</a> later this year.
